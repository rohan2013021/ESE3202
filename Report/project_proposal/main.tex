  Controlling water levels is a critical process in various industries. For 
  instance, power plants must maintain precise water levels in boilers and 
  feedwater tanks to ensure efficient and safe operations. Similarly,
  residential houses require water level control to fill overhead and
  underground tanks effectively. This task is a regular and essential activity.
  To simplify and automate this process, a microcontroller-based device can be 
  employed. The goal of this project is to

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item design and automate an efficient microcontroller-based (ESP32) water 
      level control device
    \item minimize manual intervention in water level management, thereby 
      reducing water wastage caused by human error and lowering electricity 
      costs
    \item measure the performance of the device 
  \end{enumerate}
